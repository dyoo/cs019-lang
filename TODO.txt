MISSING LANGUAGE:

- add unchecked versions of sig forms
- add support for undefined and test against shared
- Hashof:, ...
- test against last year's code
- add parameterized signatures (esp for structs)
- signature checking on list mutation
- signature checking on vector mutation
- add Char$, etc.
- bizarre parse:
  (define: s2n>> : (String$ ->> Number$) string->number)
  results in
  signature-violation: value #<procedure:string->number> failed the signature in: (Sig: string?)

ERROR MESSAGES:

- better description names for signatures
- parse-sig is losing the source location of (... -> ...)
  -- fails to highlight in or:
  -- fails in (funf 3)
- error messages don't use the right printer

DOCUMENTATION:

- need to change printer to constructor
- you can set your default #lang in the menu
- pred->sig, or:, and:, not: expect flat predicates

NICETIES:

- Indentation levels for define:, lambda:, etc.
- syntax parse
- Test with debugger
- Turn into a planet package
- Improve first-order Vectorof$ to not convert to list
- Remove redundancies in sigs.rkt
- Scribble docs
- multi-term define gets ASL error, not one from syntax-case
- quicker detection of use of HO sigs in or: and and:? BUT it cannot
  be so early as to eagerly evaluate the params, else we can't have
  forward references!

MISCELLANEOUS:

- DMdA: where did list-of go?
