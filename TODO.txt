- eliminate DMdA bindings from namespace

- get define-struct inside local to work

- make all sig positions recognize (... -> ...) syntax

- add unchecked versions of sig forms

- add support for undefined and test against shared

- error messages don't seem to use the right printer: eg,
  (define: s2n : (proc$ (String$ ->> Number$)) string->number)
  > (s2n "x")
  . . sigs.rkt:64:24: signature-violation: #f is not a number
  (prints #f instead of false)
and worse,
  (tree-sum (make-nd 10 (make-nd 5 (make-mt) (make-mt))
                        (make-nd 2 (make-nd 1 (make-mt) 10) (make-mt))))
  . . sigs.rkt:87:24: signature-violation: 10 is not a #f
  (prints #f instead of a useful name)

- documentation
  - pred->sig expects flag predicates
  - need to change printer to constructor

- quicker detection of use of HO sigs in or: and and:? BUT it cannot
be so early as to eagerly evaluate the params, else we can't have
forward references!

- Package with reader

- Vectorof:, Hashof:, ...

- better error source reporting

- better description names for signatures
